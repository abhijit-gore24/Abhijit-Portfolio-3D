# ✅ PORTFOLIO FIXES COMPLETED

## 🎉 What's Been Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Resume Download - **WORKING NOW!**
- **File**: Updated to use your actual resume `Abhijit-Full-Stack-Dev-Resume.pdf`
- **Status**: Fully functional - clicking the download button will download your resume
- **Location**: Resume section of the portfolio

### 2. ⚙️ Contact Form - **Ready for Email Setup**
- **Status**: Form is working, needs EmailJS configuration to send emails
- **What's needed**: 5-minute EmailJS setup (see `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
- **Current behavior**: Form validates input but needs API keys to send emails

### 3. ✅ Mobile Navigation - **FIXED!**
- **Issue**: Navigation was appearing in the middle on mobile
- **Fix**: Now stays at the top with horizontal layout
- **Result**: Professional mobile experience

To receive emails from your contact form:
